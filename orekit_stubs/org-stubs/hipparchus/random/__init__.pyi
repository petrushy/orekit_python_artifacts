        A :class:`~org.hipparchus.random.RandomVectorGenerator` that generates vectors with with correlated components.
    
        Random vectors with correlated components are built by combining the uncorrelated components of another random vector in
        such a way that the resulting correlations are the ones specified by a positive definite covariance matrix.
    
        The main use for correlated random vector generation is for Monte-Carlo simulation of physical problems with several
        variables, for example to generate error vectors to be added to a nominal vector. A particularly interesting case is
        when the generated vector should be drawn from a ` Multivariate Normal Distribution
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution>`. The approach using a Cholesky decomposition is quite
        usual in this case. However, it can be extended to other cases as long as the underlying random generator provides
        :class:`~org.hipparchus.random.NormalizedRandomGenerator` like :class:`~org.hipparchus.random.GaussianRandomGenerator`
        or :class:`~org.hipparchus.random.UniformRandomGenerator`.
    
        Sometimes, the covariance matrix for a given simulation is not strictly positive definite. This means that the
        correlations are not all independent from each other. In this case, however, the non strictly positive elements found
        during the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix should not be negative either, they should be null. Another
        non-conventional extension handling this case is used here. Rather than computing :code:`C = U :sup:`T` .U` where
        :code:`C` is the covariance matrix and :code:`U` is an upper-triangular matrix, we compute :code:`C = B.B :sup:`T``
        where :code:`B` is a rectangular matrix having more rows than columns. The number of columns of :code:`B` is the rank of
        the covariance matrix, and it is the dimension of the uncorrelated random vector that is needed to compute the component
        of the correlated vector. This class handles this situation automatically.
