        Generator for one column of a Jacobian matrix for special case of trigger dates.
    
        Typical use cases for this are estimation of maneuver start and stop date during either orbit determination or maneuver
        optimization.
    
        Let \((t_0, y_0)\) be the state at propagation start, \((t_1, y_1)\) be the state at maneuver trigger time, \((t_t,
        y_t)\) be the state at any arbitrary time \(t\) during propagation, and \(f_m(t, y)\) be the contribution of the
        maneuver to the global ODE \(\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)\). We are interested in the Jacobian column \(\frac{\partial
        y_t}{\partial t_1}\).
    
        There are two parts in this Jacobian: the primary part corresponds to the full contribution of the acceleration due to
        the maneuver as it is delayed by a small amount \(dt_1\), whereas the secondary part corresponds to change of
        acceleration after maneuver start as the mass depletion is delayed and therefore the spacecraft mass is different from
        the mass for nominal start time.
    
        The primary part is computed as follows. After trigger time \(t_1\) (according to propagation direction),
        \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial t_1} = \pm \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1} f_m(t_1, y_1)\] where the sign depends on
        \(t_1\) being a start or stop trigger and propagation being forward or backward.
    
        We don't have \(\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1}\) available if \(t_1 \neq t_0\), but we have \(\frac{\partial
        y_t}{\partial y_0}\) at any time since it can be computed by integrating variational equations for numerical propagation
        or by other closed form expressions for analytical propagators. We use the classical composition rule to recover the
        state transition matrix with respect to intermediate time \(t_1\): \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} = \frac{\partial
        y_t}{\partial y_1} \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0}\] We deduce \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_1} = \frac{\partial
        y_t}{\partial y_0} \left(\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0}\right)^{-1}\]
    
        The contribution of the primary part to the Jacobian column can therefore be computed using the following closed-form
        expression: \[\frac{\partial y_t}{\partial t_1} = \pm \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} \left(\frac{\partial
        y_1}{\partial y_0}\right)^{-1} f_m(t_1, y_1) = \frac{\partial y_t}{\partial y_0} c_1\] where \(c_1\) is the signed
        contribution of maneuver at \(t_1\) and is computed at trigger time by solving \(\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial y_0} c_1 =
        \pm f_m(t_1, y_1)\).
    
        As the primary part of the column is generated using a closed-form expression, this generator implements the
        :class:`~org.orekit.propagation.AdditionalStateProvider` interface and stores the column directly in the primary state
        during propagation.
    
        As the closed-form expression requires picking \(c_1\) at trigger time \(t_1\), it works only if propagation starts
        outside of the maneuver and passes over \(t_1\) during integration.
    
        The secondary part is computed as follows. We have acceleration \(\vec{\Gamma} = \frac{\vec{F}}{m}\) and \(m = m_0 - q
        (t - t_s)\), where \(m\) is current mass, \(m_0\) is initial mass and \(t_s\) is maneuver trigger time. A delay \(dt_s\)
        on trigger time induces delaying mass depletion. We get: \[d\vec{\Gamma} = \frac{-\vec{F}}{m^2} dm =
        \frac{-\vec{F}}{m^2} q dt_s = -\vec{\Gamma}\frac{q}{m} dt_s\] From this total differential, we extract the partial
        derivative of the acceleration \[\frac{\partial\vec{\Gamma}}{\partial t_s} = -\vec{\Gamma}\frac{q}{m}\]
    
        The contribution of the secondary part to the Jacobian column can therefore be computed by integrating the partial
        derivative of the acceleration, to get the partial derivative of the position.
    
        As the secondary part of the column is generated using a differential equation, a separate underlying generator
        implementing the :class:`~org.orekit.propagation.integration.AdditionalDerivativesProvider` interface is set up to
        perform the integration during propagation.
    
        This generator takes care to sum up the primary and secondary parts so the full column of the Jacobian is computed.
    
        The implementation takes care to *not* resetting \(c_1\) at propagation start. This allows to get proper Jacobian if we
        interrupt propagation in the middle of a maneuver and restart propagation where it left.

            Check if this provider should yield so another provider has an opportunity to add missing parts.
        
            Decision to yield is often based on an additional state being
            :meth:`~org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState.hasAdditionalState` in the provided :code:`state` (but it could
            theoretically also depend on an additional state derivative being
            :meth:`~org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState.hasAdditionalStateDerivative`, or any other criterion). If for example a
            provider needs the state transition matrix, it could implement this method as:
        
            .. code-block: java
            
             public boolean yields(final SpacecraftState state) {
                 return !state.getAdditionalStates().containsKey("STM");
             }
             
        
            The default implementation returns :code:`false`, meaning that state data can be
            :meth:`~org.orekit.propagation.AdditionalStateProvider.getAdditionalState` immediately.
        
            The column state can be computed only if the State Transition Matrix state is available.

                interface :class:`~org.orekit.propagation.AdditionalStateProvider`
        
            Parameters:
                state (:class:`~org.orekit.propagation.SpacecraftState`): state to handle
        
            Returns:
                true if this provider should yield so another provider has an opportunity to add missing parts as the state is
                incrementally built up
