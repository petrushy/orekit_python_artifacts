        several advantages to having such root-finding algorithms:
    
          - The bracketed solution guarantees that the root is kept within the interval. As such, these algorithms generally also
            guarantee convergence.
          - The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only return roots that are greater than or equal to the

            over-approximations are :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.AllowedSolution`. Other root-finding algorithms can
            usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that was found) is around the actual root.

        Interface for :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.UnivariateSolver` that maintain a bracketed solution. There are
        several advantages to having such root-finding algorithms:
    
          - The bracketed solution guarantees that the root is kept within the interval. As such, these algorithms generally also
            guarantee convergence.
          - The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only return roots that are greater than or equal to the
            actual root, or are less than or equal to the actual root. That is, we can control whether under-approximations and
            over-approximations are :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.AllowedSolution`. Other root-finding algorithms can
            usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that was found) is around the actual root.
    
    
        For backwards compatibility, all root-finding algorithms must have
        :meth:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.AllowedSolution.ANY_SIDE` as default for the allowed solutions.

        This class implements the ` Muller's Method <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MullersMethod.html>` for root finding of real
        univariate functions. For reference, see **Elementary Numerical Analysis**, ISBN 0070124477, chapter 3.
    
        Muller's method applies to both real and complex functions, but here we restrict ourselves to real functions. This class
        differs from :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.MullerSolver` in the way it avoids complex operations.
    
        Muller's original method would have function evaluation at complex point. Since our f(x) is real, we have to find ways
        to avoid that. Bracketing condition is one way to go: by requiring bracketing in every iteration, the newly computed
        approximation is guaranteed to be real.
    
        Normally Muller's method converges quadratically in the vicinity of a zero, however it may be very slow in regions far
        away from zeros. For example, f(x) = exp(x) - 1, min = -50, max = 100. In such case we use bisection as a safety backup
        if it performs very poorly.
    
        The formulas here use divided differences directly.

        Except for the initial [min, max], it does not require bracketing condition, e.g. f(x0), f(x1), f(x2) can have the same
        sign. If a complex number arises in the computation, we simply use its modulus as a real approximation.
    
        Because the interval may not be bracketing, the bisection alternative is not applicable here. However in practice our
        treatment usually works well, especially near real zeroes where the imaginary part of the complex approximation is often
        negligible.
    
        The formulas here do not use divided differences directly.

        Implements the *Regula Falsi* or *False position* method for root-finding (approximating a zero of a univariate real
        function). It is a modified :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.SecantSolver` method.
    
        The *Regula Falsi* method is included for completeness, for testing purposes, for educational purposes, for comparison
        to other algorithms, etc. It is however **not** intended to be used for actual problems, as one of the bounds often
        remains fixed, resulting in very slow convergence. Instead, one of the well-known modified *Regula Falsi* algorithms can
        be used (:class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.IllinoisSolver` or
        :class:`~org.hipparchus.analysis.solvers.PegasusSolver`). These two algorithms solve the fundamental issues of the
        original *Regula Falsi* algorithm, and greatly out-performs it for most, if not all, (practical) functions.
    
        Unlike the *Secant* method, the *Regula Falsi* guarantees convergence, by maintaining a bracketed solution. Note
        however, that due to the finite/limited precision of Java's null type, which is used in this implementation, the
        algorithm may get stuck in a situation where it no longer makes any progress. Such cases are detected and result in a
        :code:`MathIllegalStateException` exception being thrown. In other words, the algorithm theoretically guarantees
        convergence, but the implementation does not.
